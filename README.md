NC-news

This is a personal project for a React hosted website that utilises an API built in a previous project: https://github.com/alexmurdoch/nc-news-project.
The project makes use of API calls to access and alter data in a series of collections in a database.
The website uses multiple pages, has the ability to add comments and upvote articles and data. You can also delete comments.
You can filter through the data by topic, author and botes and sort by ascending or descending order.

The app uses React and Axios.
